IMPORTANT: There was a very limited time to code this game among creating many
kinds of content, implementing them and doing work for other courses at the same
time, so instead of keeping all the comments up-to-date in the final relase,
I prioritized my time in testing and fixing the bugs.

Student Project in TAMK Spring 2020.
General info on https://19tiko1d.projects.tamk.fi/

The game can be played in Google Play
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fi.tuni.tiko.digging

This repository includes only the java files and not the whole libGDX/
Android project.

99% of the code is my own work while a person in the same student
project team contributed with a couple of methods regarding graphics
implementation.
